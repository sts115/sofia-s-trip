<h2>First day</h2>

<p>My trip to London was incredible, when we arrived the first thing we did was check in at the hotel where we were staying near Trafalgar Square</p>

<p>After that we went to a cafe because we hadn't eaten, it was super nice, I ordered a sandwich and a donut, my mom preferred just a coffee, then we went to a small market and bought some very cute porcelain figurines.</p>

<h2>Second day</h2>
<p>Visit the British Museum, admiring the Rosetta Stone and Egyptian mummies. Then, a tour of Borough Market offers me gastronomic delights: from artisanal cheeses to delicious desserts.</p>

<h3>Last day</h3>
<p>I decide to spend the last day relaxing in Hyde Park. I rent a bike and ride its extensive trails. Afterwards, I head to Oxford Street for a shopping session. Iconic brand stores and unique boutiques fill my day with exciting finds.</p>
